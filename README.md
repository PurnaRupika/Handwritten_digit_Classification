# Handwritten_digit_Classification

This project implements a deep learning model to classify handwritten digits (0â€“9) from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. It demonstrates both Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for image recognition tasks.

Artificial Neural Network (ANN):
Accuracy: ~97%
